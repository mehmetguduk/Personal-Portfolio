                    Hello There! I'm Mehmet Güdük. I was born on November 05, 1998 in Ankara, Turkey. As someone who grew up
                    with computer technology, any work in relation to computers is a massive passion for me. I discovered my
                    interest in design when I installed Adobe Photoshop CS6 on my computer a long time ago. Working on
                    photos for hours with some chill background music was utterly joyful. Later, I continued this interest
                    by making vector drawings with Adobe Photoshop Illustrator. Then realized that I can turn this into web
                    development.
                    <br /><br />
                    At the beginning I learned the basics of Javascript, HTML5, CSS through courses that I found on the
                    internet. Later, with the clones and demos I made, I developed my web design knowledge by constantly
                    encountering errors and solving them. I continue to improve myself every day.
                    <br /><br />
                    During my encounter of several projects, I have mastered the following tools: HTML5 markup language; CSS
                    style sheet language and SASS-SCSS variations; Javascript, TypeScript, Python, C# programming languages;
                    Node.JS, Angular, .NET Framework, .NET Core, Asp.NET frameworks; jQuery and plugins made with jQuery;
                    React and Bootstrap libraries; MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite database systems; AWS hosting service; Kali Linux,
                    Windows 10 operating systems; Notepad++, PyCharm, Visual Studio Code compilers; Git, GitHub version
                    controllers.
